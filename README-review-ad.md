# Code for Review (Aditya)

Code to review is all of [TruthTableCreate.fs](https://github.com/adidesh20/issie/blob/master/src/Renderer/Simulator/TruthTableCreate.fs), which comes out to 268 lines inclusive of comments and blank lines.

This is the main top-level logic for the generation of Truth Tables in Issie. It may be useful to browse [TruthTableTypes.fs](https://github.com/adidesh20/issie/blob/master/src/Renderer/Simulator/TruthTableTypes.fs) for additional information and context.
